3216,'The redemption period is a Domain Registry period of up to 30 days that occurs when a domain name is deleted after having expired unrenewed. Instead of just getting deleted and returning to the pool of domain names available for registration, the existing registrar keeps a hold on the domain name.\n \nDuring this 30-day redemption period, the original domain registrant (owner of the domain) is allowed to retrieve the domain name from deletion by contacting their Registrar. This process carries an additional fee. This extra 30-day redemption period extends the time available to renew expired domain names. However, all names that enter the redemption period are removed from the zone files in the global DNS, as a result, any Web site or email services associated with the domain name gone into redemption period will stop working and would appear offline.\n \nTo break it down, when a domain expires you have 30 days to pay for the domain renewal. After this time there is another 30 day period called redemption which you can still retrieve your domain back but with a fee attached ($75 redemption fee + Domain renewal fee in the case with eNom). Now after the domain has last this redemption period there is another 30-60 days (depending on the registrar) before it is released to the public, at which point people can register the domain.\n \nIf you do not want to pay the redemption fee, you have two options:\n \n1. Register a new domain ( .net, .org, or a brand new domain altogether)\n \n2. Wait until it is released back to the public and register it again.\n \nThe time frame for this varies from registrar to registrar, the only way to be sure is either constantly checking a whois look up to see if the domain is available for registration or using a domain reservation service that some registrars offer. You can use a whois look up site like http://whois.domaintools.com to check.\n \nWaiting for it to be released is not guaranteed however.

3456,'The redemption period is a Domain Registry period of up to 30 days that occurs when a domain name is deleted after having expired unrenewed. Instead of just getting deleted and returning to the pool of domain names available for registration, the existing registrar keeps a hold on the domain name.\n \nDuring this 30-day redemption period, the original domain registrant (owner of the domain) is allowed to retrieve the domain name from deletion by contacting their Registrar. This process carries an additional fee. This extra 30-day redemption period extends the time available to renew expired domain names. However, all names that enter the redemption period are removed from the zone files in the global DNS, as a result, any Web site or email services associated with the domain name gone into redemption period will stop working and would appear offline.\n \nTo break it down, when a domain expires you have 30 days to pay for the domain renewal. After this time there is another 30 day period called redemption which you can still retrieve your domain back but with a fee attached ($75 redemption fee + Domain renewal fee in the case with eNom). Now after the domain has last this redemption period there is another 30-60 days (depending on the registrar) before it is released to the public, at which point people can register the domain.\n \nIf you do not want to pay the redemption fee, you have two options:\n \n1. Register a new domain ( .net, .org, or a brand new domain altogether)\n \n2. Wait until it is released back to the public and register it again.\n \nThe time frame for this varies from registrar to registrar, the only way to be sure is either constantly checking a whois look up to see if the domain is available for registration or using a domain reservation service that some registrars offer. You can use a whois look up site like http://whois.domaintools.com to check.\n \nWaiting for it to be released is not guaranteed however.
